Connecting to the database is straightforward. Just pass in your username and password to the connect_to_data function 

```{r connect}
sm = connect_to_data(username = "XXXX", 
                     password = "XXXX")
```

Getting demographics is also simple. 

```{r demographics}
demographics = get_demographics(supermart = "supermart_xxx", 
                                sandbox = "sandbox_xxx", 
                                cohort = 'hypertension_cohort')
```
